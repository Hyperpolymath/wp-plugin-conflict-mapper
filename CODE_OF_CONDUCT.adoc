== Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

== Our Standards

=== Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and helping them learn
* Respecting people's time and effort

=== Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests
* Sustained disruption of community discussions

== Emotional Safety

[NOTE]
====
We recognize that open source development can be emotionally demanding.
====

We commit to:

*Reversibility*::
All decisions can be revisited and changed. No choice is final. We embrace the freedom to experiment and evolve.

*Experimentation*::
Encourage trying new approaches without fear of failure. Innovation requires safe exploration.

*No Blame Culture*::
Focus on learning from mistakes, not assigning blame. Errors are opportunities for growth.

*Mental Health*::
Respect contributors' boundaries and availability. Your wellbeing comes first.

*Sustainable Pace*::
Discourage overwork and burnout. Sustainable contribution is more valuable than heroic sprints.

*Constructive Critique*::
Focus on ideas and code, not people. Technical disagreement is healthy; personal attacks are not.

== Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

== Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event

== Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

*conduct@hyperpolymath.com*

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

== Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

=== 1. Correction

*Community Impact*:: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

*Consequence*:: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

=== 3. Temporary Ban

*Community Impact*:: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

*Consequence*:: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
